# Follow-up Items for PR #3 — Quality sweep

The original quality sweep landed in commit `4dfc445` ("Bring locations
module up to quality") on top of an earlier PR #2 follow-up commit
(`a341c50`). At the time of merge there were no external reviews — the
sweep itself implemented the entire C2–C10 + part of C11 from the
workspace playbook.

This file tracks subsequent re-validation passes that bring the module
forward to the evolving post-Apr pipeline (new C-step requirements
added since the original sweep).

## Batch 2 — re-validation 2026-04-26

Second module under the post-Apr re-validation template (canonical
template: AI module, BeamLabEU/phoenix_kit_ai#5). Phase 1 PR triage
re-verified clean; Phase 2 mainly adds C-step deltas the original
sweep didn't have prompts for.

### Async UX (C5)

- ~~`phx-disable-with` on `show_delete_confirm` buttons (4 sites in
  `locations_live.ex:293/303/348/358`)~~ — **FALSE POSITIVE**.
  `show_delete_confirm` opens a modal (`@confirm_delete = {type, uuid}`)
  and is UI-state-only per AGENTS.md C5 ("`UI-state-only buttons
  (modal_close, switch_view) don't need it`"). The actual destructive
  click is the modal's confirm button (in core's
  `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.Modal.confirm_modal/1`), which is
  out-of-scope for this module sweep.

### Defensive `handle_info` catch-all (C10)

- `locations_live.ex`, `location_form_live.ex`, `location_type_form_live.ex`
  had no `handle_info/2` clause at all. Phoenix.LiveView's default
  silently drops unmatched messages, but adding an explicit
  `Logger.debug` catch-all means a future PubSub subscribe (or a
  multilang-hook fall-through) won't go unnoticed in dev. Pattern matches
  the workspace sync precedent at AGENTS.md:678-680.

### `enabled?/0` `catch :exit` (AGENTS.md:911)

- `phoenix_kit_locations.ex:40-44` had only `rescue _ -> false`; added
  `catch :exit, _ -> false` so a sandbox-shutdown trap (the 1-in-N
  flake AGENTS.md:911 describes) returns the documented fallback
  rather than surfacing the exit. Matches the AI module's
  `enabled?/0` shape exactly.

### Test infrastructure (C7)

- Added `phoenix_kit_settings` table to `test/support/postgres/migrations/`.
  Mirrors core's real schema (uuid/key/value/value_json/module/
  date_added/date_updated per AGENTS.md:921-925). Without it, every
  test that triggered a `Settings.get_boolean_setting` call from the
  LV mount path (multilang languages_enabled, locations_enabled) saw
  a `relation "phoenix_kit_settings" does not exist` Logger.error.
  With the table present, the table lookup succeeds (empty row →
  default value) but core still logs a `DBConnection.OwnershipError`
  for processes outside the sandbox owner — a pre-existing log-noise
  pattern that lives upstream in core's `Settings.get_boolean_setting/2`
  Logger.error (fires *before* our outer rescue point). See AGENTS.md:1075-1076
  for the AI module's identical observation.

### Errors test pin (C8)

- `errors_test.exs` removed the `is_binary/1`-loop smell (the
  per-atom EXACT-string asserts above are sufficient pinning). Same
  shape as AI module batch 2.

### `@spec` backfill on small public surfaces (C12 #3)

- `paths.ex` — added `@spec` to all 6 public functions
  (`index/0`, `location_new/0`, `location_edit/1`, `types/0`,
  `type_new/0`, `type_edit/1`).

### Documentation (C13)

- `AGENTS.md` — added the canonical "What This Module Does NOT Have"
  section at the bottom (no PubSub, no soft-delete, no Oban, no
  external HTTP, no public API routes, no file uploads, no wizard
  form, no postal-registry validation). Pinning these in writing
  prevents future scope creep and makes review-finding triage faster.
- `README.md` — added "Error Handling" subsection (Errors atom →
  gettext message, with a one-liner example) and "Activity Logging"
  subsection. The Errors module landed in PR #3 but README didn't
  mention it; agents read the README first.

### Pinning tests (C11)

- `phoenix_kit_locations/web/locations_live_test.exs`,
  `location_form_live_test.exs`,
  `location_type_form_live_test.exs` — `handle_info` catch-all smoke
  per LV. Sends two unknown messages to `view.pid`, asserts
  `render(view)` returns a binary. If the catch-all clause regresses
  to a `FunctionClauseError`, the round-trip fails.

## Skipped / surfaced from Batch 2 (closed in Batch 3)

- ~~**Activity logging on `:error` branch.**~~ Closed in Batch 3a — see below.
- ~~**LV-level `actor_uuid:` pinning in delete tests.**~~ Closed in Batch 3b — see below.
- **Pre-existing log spam from core's `Settings.get_boolean_setting/2`.**
  Still open. See "Test infrastructure (C7)" above and AGENTS.md:1075-1076.
  Suppressing the upstream Logger.error lives in core, not this
  module.

## Batch 3 — fix-everything pass 2026-04-26

Max authorised closing every Batch-2 surfaced item. Two gaps remained
after Batch 2; both are closed here, plus a small edge-case-test
expansion that exercises new code paths.

### Batch 3a — `:error`-branch activity logging

- `locations.ex` `log_activity/5` pipe step gained an `{:error,
  %Ecto.Changeset{}}` clause that logs the same action with a
  PII-safe `%{db_pending: true, error_fields: [...]}` metadata map
  before passing the tuple through unchanged. The audit trail now
  captures the user-initiated action even when the primary write
  fails (unique-constraint violation, FK rollback, etc.).
- `sync_location_types/3` and `add_location_type/3` use the
  non-pipe `maybe_log_activity/5` directly — both got matching
  `:error`-branch calls so the pattern is uniform across all
  mutations.
- New helpers: `changeset_resource_uuid/1` (falls back to
  `changeset.data.uuid`, which is `nil` for inserts and the
  pre-existing UUID for updates), `changeset_error_metadata/1`
  (extracts the field names that errored — never the rejected
  values themselves).
- Two pre-existing "failed create does not log" tests in
  `activity_logging_test.exs` were inverted to "failed create logs
  with `db_pending: true`" — these now pin both the new behaviour
  AND the PII safety (assertions on `error_fields` membership, no
  raw value leakage).

### Batch 3b — Scope injection + LV `actor_uuid` pins

- New `test/support/hooks.ex` (`PhoenixKitLocations.Test.Hooks`)
  with an `:assign_scope` `on_mount` callback mirroring
  `phoenix_kit_hello_world/test/support/hooks.ex`. Reads
  `"phoenix_kit_test_scope"` from the test session and assigns
  `:phoenix_kit_current_scope` + `:phoenix_kit_current_user` onto
  socket assigns at LV mount.
- `test_router.ex` `live_session :locations_test` now passes
  `on_mount: {PhoenixKitLocations.Test.Hooks, :assign_scope}`.
- `LiveCase` gained `fake_scope/1` (returns a real
  `PhoenixKit.Users.Auth.Scope` struct — `cached_roles` is a list
  of role-name strings per AGENTS.md:1175 even though locations
  doesn't call `Scope.admin?/1`) and `put_test_scope/2` (plugs the
  scope into the conn session).
- Every delete test in `locations_live_test.exs` and every
  successful-save test in `location_form_live_test.exs` /
  `location_type_form_live_test.exs` now sets a fake scope and
  asserts `assert_activity_logged(action, resource_uuid: ...,
  actor_uuid: scope.user.uuid)`. Previously these tests would have
  passed silently if the LV dropped `actor_opts/1` from the call.

### Batch 3c — Edge-case tests in `locations_test.exs`

Five new tests in the `changeset validations` describe block:

- **Unicode round-trip** — name (`東京本部 — Tōkyō HQ 🗼`), city
  (`東京`), country (`日本`), public_notes (mixed Japanese + Cyrillic
  + Latin) round-trip byte-for-byte through create + reload.
- **SQL metacharacters** — five payloads (`'); DROP TABLE …`, `\"
  OR 1=1`, `<script>` tag, `\\u0000 NUL`, embedded newlines/tabs)
  insert and round-trip without crashing or escaping. Pins
  Ecto's parameterised-query behaviour at the integration level.
- **Name >255 chars** — explicit length-error structure assert
  (`{:length, kind: :max, type: :string, count: 255}`), not just
  `errors_on(cs).name`.
- **Phone >50 chars** — length validation rejects.
- **Postal code >20 chars** — length validation rejects.
